## Day 1

Topic: learn c++ basics

- Libraries in cpp `#include <library_name>`
- Every C++ project HAS to be a function called `main()`
	- Main is a function, so don't forget the parenthesis `()` 
- Data Output `std::cout << "@danielhe4rtless" << std::endl;`
	- Belongs to `iostream` (input/output stream) library
	- Operator << means that we're passing something in the direction. In the case, we're passing the `std::endl` 
	- `std::` means that we're using functions from base libraries, or from the namespace `std::`
-  Compiling programs: the compilers looks for each .cpp file listed on your includes and do two important tasks:
	- First: It checks if you code is on the right shape for the C++ syntax. If not, you're going to throw an error in your terminal.
	- Second: converts your source code into binary code. It normally have the extension `file.o` or `file.obj`.
- Linker
	- I don't understand a single fuck but soon we're gonna be here on this topic again.
- Variables
	- Same thing as every other language, declare and use it.
